MULE GAME
Started 9/12/2015

For the past four months, while learning about UML and Agile concepts,this team consisting of Ashley Noll, Riley Auten, Shannor Trotty, Melanie Smith,
and Sonali Singh worked on recreating an old Atari game called MULE. 

Players start off with a set amount of resources, land, and money.
They can purchase Mule to place on their land allowing the land to produce resources for them.
Players can also sell resources they have acquired in exchange for money, which they can use to purchase additonal land.
After twelve turns, players attempt to have more money and resources than their opponents.
